# üçÉ Advanced Git Search

An advanced git search extension for `Telescope` and `fzf-lua`.

Search your git history by commit message, content and author in Neovim

## üöÄ Usage

[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO0uYLlHtYo)

- __üìñ Open a picker__

    `:AdvancedGitSearch` or `:AdvancedGitSearch {command}`

- __üîé Enter a query__

    Your usual search experience. See the individual commands for the grep behaviour.

- __‚úèÔ∏è Further search on commit author with `@`__

    The prompt is split on `@`. Everything following the `@` is the pattern for
the author name.

    -- fugitive or diffview
    diff_plugin = "fugitive",
    -- customize git in previewer
    -- e.g. flags such as { "--no-pager" }, or { "-c", "delta.side-by-side=false" }
    git_flags = {},
    -- customize git diff in previewer
    -- e.g. flags such as { "--raw" }
    git_diff_flags = {},
    -- Show builtin git pickers when executing "show_custom_functions" or :AdvancedGitSearch
    show_builtin_git_pickers = false,
    entry_default_author_or_date = "author", -- one of "author" or "date"
    keymaps = {
        -- following keymaps can be overridden
        toggle_date_author = "<C-w>",
        open_commit_in_browser = "<C-o>",
        copy_commit_hash = "<C-y>",
        show_entire_commit = "<C-e>",
    }

    -- Telescope layout setup
    telescope_theme = {
        function_name_1 = {
            -- Theme options
        },
        function_name_2 = "dropdown"

        },

    }
}
```

    -- to open commits in browser with fugitive
    "tpope/vim-rhubarb",
    -- optional: to replace the diff from fugitive with diffview.nvim
